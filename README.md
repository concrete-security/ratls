# RA-TLS Toolkit

Portable Remote Attestation for the modern web. This toolkit delivers verified TLS connections to TEEs from browsers (via WASM) without relying on platform-native attestation stacks.

---

# 1. Project Overview & Quickstart

## Key Features
- Browser-first verification: full attestation performed inside WASM.
- Configurable policy engine: enforce TCB levels, measurements, advisory IDs.
- Supported TEEs: Intel TDX today; AMD SEV-SNP planned.

---

# 2. Architecture & Data Flow

Browsers lack raw TCP sockets and attestation primitives. The toolkit uses WebSocket/WebTransport tunnels to work around these limitations.

1. **Handshake:** WASM client completes TLS 1.3 over a WebSocket connection.
2. **Quote Fetch:** Client issues an HTTP request to fetch the hardware quote.
3. **Verification:** `ratls-core` validates the quote against the TLS certificate and user policy.

# 3. Component Guide

## `core/`
- `ratls_connect`: Handshake + verification over a generic async byte stream.
- `PromiscuousVerifier`: Accepts any X.509 initially, captures leaf cert for post-handshake validation.
- `TdxTcbPolicy`: Encodes acceptable TDX TCB levels and measurements.

## `wasm/`
- `RatlsHttp`: HTTP client over attested TLS with chunked transfer encoding support.
- `AttestedStream`: Low-level attested TLS stream for custom protocols.
- `createRatlsFetch(...)`: Fetch-compatible API for browser applications.

Example:
```javascript
import { createRatlsFetch } from "./pkg/ratls-fetch.js";

const fetch = createRatlsFetch({
  proxyUrl: "ws://127.0.0.1:9000",
  targetHost: "secure-enclave.com",
  onAttestation: (att) => console.log("TEE:", att.teeType)
});

const response = await fetch("/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ model: "gpt", messages: [...] })
});

// Streaming works (chunked encoding handled in WASM)
for await (const chunk of response.body) { /* ... */ }
console.log(response.attestation); // { trusted: true, teeType: "Tdx", ... }
```

## Additional Directories
- `python/`: PyO3 bindings with async helpers.
- `server-examples/`: Reference RA-TLS servers for TDX/SNP (coming soon).
- `docs/`: Design notes, specs, and task tracking.

## Binding status
- WASM: functional; provides `RatlsHttp`, `AttestedStream`, and `createRatlsFetch`.
- Python: scaffolding in progress (`python/README.md`) with planned async API parity once the core pieces stabilize.

# 4. Policy Configuration

Policies describe what constitutes an acceptable attestation. The `ratls-core` API (and each binding) consumes a `Policy` struct with the following shape:

```json
{
  "tee_type": "Tdx",
  "allowed_tdx_status": ["UpToDate", "SWHardeningNeeded"],
  "minimum_tcb": {
    "svn": 3,
    "mrseam": "hex bytes",
    "mrtd": "hex bytes"
  },
  "advisories_blocklist": ["INTEL-SA-00999"],
  "allow_debug": false,
  "expected_measurements": [
    {
      "rtmr_index": 3,
      "sha256": "hex bytes for TLS key binding event"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tee_type` | Chooses the verifier backend (`Tdx`, `Snp`, etc.). |
| `allowed_tdx_status` | Acceptable `TD_REPORT.STATUS` strings (e.g., `UpToDate`). |
| `minimum_tcb` | Lower bounds for SVN plus MRSEAM/MRTD digests to block downgraded builds. |
| `advisories_blocklist` | Rejects quotes referencing these advisory IDs. |
| `allow_debug` | Permits debug TEEs when `true` (default `false`). |
| `expected_measurements` | Optional event/measurement checks, including TLS key hash binding. |

Verification flow with a policy:
1. Confirm the quote matches `tee_type`.
2. Ensure the reported status is in `allowed_tdx_status`.
3. Compare SVN and measurement digests to `minimum_tcb`.
4. Verify no blocked advisories are reported.
5. Enforce `allow_debug`.
6. Recalculate listed measurements (e.g., TLS pubkey hash in RTMR3) and compare to `expected_measurements`.

# 5. Protocol Specification

### Step 1: TLS Handshake
- TLS 1.3 with a promiscuous verifier. The certificate is accepted temporarily and recorded.

### Step 2: Quote Retrieval
Client sends an HTTP POST over the established TLS channel:
```http
POST /tdx_quote HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "report_data": "<hex_nonce>"
}
```

Server responds:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "quote": {
    "quote": "<hex_tdx_quote>",
    "event_log": [...]
  },
  "collateral": { ... }
}
```

### Step 3: Verification
1. Validate the quote signature using Intel PCCS collateral (`dcap-qvl` flow).
2. Ensure `report_data` equals the client nonce (freshness).
3. Recompute RTMR3 by replaying every event log entry in order and ensure the final digest matches the quote.
4. During that replay, locate the TLS key binding event (contains the certificate pubkey hash) to prove the attested workload owns the negotiated TLS key.

# Development Reference

## Directory Structure
- `core/`: Verification + policy.
- `wasm/`: Browser bindings.
- `server-examples/`: Forthcoming reference TEEs.

## Build Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make test` | Run Rust unit tests for core. |
| `make test-wasm` | Check build for the `wasm32` target. |
| `make build-wasm` | Compile the WASM package into `pkg/`. |

## Troubleshooting WASM Builds
- Errors like `rust-lld: error: unknown file type` typically mean LLVM/Clang lacks `wasm32` support.
- On macOS, run `make setup-wasm` to install a compatible LLVM via Homebrew, then re-run `make build-wasm`.
